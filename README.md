# Critter Caravan

This repository has submodules. Ensure you either:
* A) Clone only the submodules you wish to work this (e.g. Client + Asset Deps or Server), or
* B) Clone the repository with recursive submodules. You can do this with `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mgomezdev1/critter-caravan.git`.

If you have already cloned the repository without submodules, use `git submodule update --init --recursive` to load all submodules.

# Running Critter Caravan

You will find the instructions to run each of the submodules in their respective READMEs. But as a quick note; you will need *PHP v8 and Laravel v11* to run the Server, and you will need *Unity v6* to run the client.

We do not currently distribute native executables for either of the submodules.
